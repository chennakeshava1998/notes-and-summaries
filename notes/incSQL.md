- sequence-2-action model
- uses a non-deterministic oracle. This oracle permits multiple correct action sequences from a partial parse. This method alleviates the oeder-matters problem.
- 

#### Key points
1. seq2seq(based on machine translation) approaches suffer from order-matters problem.
2. slot-filling methods doesn't use the interdependencies between the slots.
3. 

#### Doubts:
1. How does the oracle work?
2. Is it possible to use an RL approach in selecting the optimum actions?
